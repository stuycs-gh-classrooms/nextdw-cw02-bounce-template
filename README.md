### Task 4: Program modification
Add a 4th circle that behaves as follows:
- Is should start at a random position inside the screen (but should be fully visible) and be the same size as the other circles.
- Initially, it should move one pixel down and one pixel to the left.
- When it reaches one of the screen edges, it should "bounce" in the same way that the other circles bounce.
